# 🌞 Warm-up

Introduce an artwork that use mouseClicked() 

# 🗣️ Teach

**MAP**

- The map( ) function is used to re-map a number to another range.
- map( ) can be used to make more interesting interaction with mouse.
- Demo: Moving mouse to change grayscale
    
    ```jsx
    let grayValue;
    grayValue = map(mouseY, 0, windowHeight, 0, 255);
    fill(grayValue);
    circle(100, 100, 50);
    ```
    
- Use lerpColor() to blend color
    
    ```jsx
    // Using lerpColor to create gradient 
    ```
    

# 🏄🏻‍♂️ Activity: Changing color

Continue with the drawing of your window in the last session. 

- Changing color of an element according to mouse movement.
    
    For example: Mouse move up and down to change the color of the sky from light to dark.  
    

# 🗣️ Teach

**IF CONDITION**

- Introduce if statement:
    - Can be used to control the flow of our code following the syntax
        
        > if (*condition*) {*expression*} 
        else {*expression*}
        > 
        
        ```jsx
        if (*condition*) 
        	{code will be executed when the condition is satisfied} 
        else 
        	{code will be executed when the condition is not satisfied}
        ```
        
    - Execution order
        - Code will be executed from top to bottom and from inside out.
    - Notice the use of ( ) and { }.
    - Notice the indentation.
- if-statement can be used to control interactivity and animation.
- Simple demo: Moving mouse → change sketch color.
    
    ```jsx
    TBD 
    ```
    
- Using map( ) function and lerpColor( ) for color transition.

# 🏄🏻‍♂️ Activity: Changing color

- Changing color of an element when hovering onto them.

# 🏄🏻‍♂️ Activity: Open and close door

Continue with the drawing of your window in the last session. 

- Design an on-screen button to open/close the window of the drawing.

# ☕️ BREAK

# 🗣️ Teach

- Live code bouncing ball.
    
    ```jsx
    TBD
    ```
    
    - Use Boolean variable to create a toggle for backward and forward.
    - Use random( ) to make it go in random direction.
- Practice tidy code

# 🏄🏻‍♂️ Activity: Bouncing ball

Code your bouncing ball. 

From the sketch of a moving ball in the previous session, write a pseudo code to make it bounce. 

*(The ball goes backward when hitting the wall.)*

# 🗣️ Teach

MOUSE INTERACTIVITY

- Beside mouseX, mouseY also offer other variables / function that listen to mouse.
- pMouseX, pMouseY: variables that contains the coordination of mouse in the previous frame.
- mousePressed(), mouseClicked(): built-in functions that listen to the click event.
    - These functions are called separately outside of the draw() function as they don’t need to be called in every frame.
    - Students can explore other functions: mouseDragged(), mouseReleased(), and doubleClicked() on their own.
- keyPressed() and keyCode.
    - Organize all the key interaction within the keyPress() function
- In order to not confuse the students, we only teach them to organize all the interaction with mouse in mousePressed() and all the interaction with keyboard in keyPressed(). We are not using mouseIsPressed and keyIsPressed for now.

**TIDY CODE**

- Indent is important in coding as it defines the scope of your line of code and its order to be executed.
- Using “Tidy Code” to quickly format the code.
- Also adding documentation using “//” to help not only others who use the code but also the writer in future adjustment.

# 🏄🏻‍♂️ Activity: Make your screen saver

- Make a screen saver that:
    - Has something that moves around and bounces or react to the borders of the window.
    - The screen waits for 5 seconds to start the screen-saver and clear when mouse Press.
        - Hint: using clear() to clear your canvas.
    - While in the screensaver mode, press a secret key to open a secret visual.
- Students can turn the previous “Window” sketch into a screensaver.
- Code needs to be tidied and documented.
