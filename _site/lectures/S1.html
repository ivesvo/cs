<h3 id="the-idea-of-programming">The idea of programming</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The main concept of programming bases around <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">input → code → output</code>. <em>Think about code as a machine that takes inputs as ingredients and spits out output as dishes</em>.</li>
  <li>Each of the example projects includes “coding” in different way, but it still follows the above idea of code. What are the <em>inputs</em> and <em>outputs</em> of each project?
    <ul>
      <li>Clappy Bird: clap (sound) → animation on screen (visual)</li>
      <li>Music by Hand: hand movement (visual signal via sensor) → music playing (sound)</li>
      <li>Crystal Palace: pray movement (visual signal via camera) → data to trigger the bubble machine (physical computing)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In each project, how do we (or the subject) communicate with the machine?
    <ul>
      <li>Clappy Bird: clap → change of sound amplitude → code → change of the location of visual element on screen</li>
      <li>Music by Hand: movement of hand → change of input data → code → change of music frequency.</li>
      <li>Deep Swamp: movement of body → change of input data → code → change of the state of the bubble machine.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Code is a set of rules (algorithms) that maps the input into the output. Or here, adjust the output according to the change of input.</li>
  <li>This links to our course philosophy: to use coding as a medium to document and react to the change of the nature around us.</li>
  <li>Show some projects that are built using p5.js. This can be teacher’s personal projects, past students projects, other artists, or the <a href="https://showcase.p5js.org/#/">p5 Showcase</a>. Based on this, students can have a sense of what p5 can do and what to expect as an outcome of this class in term of technicality.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-programming">What is programming?</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Computers are devices, including PC, laptop, or mobile phone.</li>
  <li>Programming is a set of instructions to tell computers what to do. In other words, it maps inputs into outputs.</li>
  <li>Instructions are written in code. Thus, the process of writing the instructions is call “coding” or “programming”.</li>
  <li>The purposes of programming are to automate, to connect, and to scale.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="programming-for-creativity">Programming for creativity</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Programming expands creative possibilities by expanding material, method, and interactivity.</li>
  <li>Programming can also integrate into other different disciplines.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="programming-with-p5js">Programming with p5.js</h3>

<p>In this course, we learn to code using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p5.js</code>. It is a library, written on the language of Javascript. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p5.js</code> is designed for coders who want to create interactive, visual programs that run directly in a web page. It’s designed for creative coding, and it sits right at the intersection of coding and art.</p>

<p>📖 Show some projects that are built using p5.js. This can be teacher’s personal projects, past students’ projects, other artists’, or the <a href="https://showcase.p5js.org/#/">p5 Showcase</a>. Based on this, students can have a sense of what p5 can do and what to expect as an outcome of this class in term of technicality.</p>

<h3 id="advantages-of-p5js">Advantages of p5.js</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Designed for creative coding.</li>
  <li>Can be integrated with other platforms.</li>
  <li>Collaborative: easy to show, duplicate, and share.</li>
  <li>Easy to access: p5 editor, documentation, and supporting resources.</li>
  <li>Open source.</li>
  <li>The Processing Community.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="️activity-human-fax-machine">🏄🏻‍♂️ Activity: Human Fax Machine</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Students are divided into pairs. Each pair is given a serie of drawings that they need to copy.
But only one member can see the drawing and they need to use words to guide the other to draw.</li>
  <li>Drawings are simple shapes that range from easy to difficult to draw. For example:
<img src="/lectures/assets/s1_thumb_1.png" /></li>
</ul>

<p><b>REFLECTION</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>What we have done is a metaphor of programming with the instructor as programmer, the painter as computer, and the action of instructing to draw is programming.</li>
  <li>Drawing instructions need to follow some sort of agreements - <i>rules</i> and <i>coordinate system</i>
    <ul>
      <li>Rules: The instructor and the painter must agree on terms and concepts like “what does it mean by saying <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rectangle</code>?”, “what does it mean by saying <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">repeat</code>?”. Agreement on this forms a standard instruction between the instructor and the painter. Or in the context of programming, between the writer and the computer, we call it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">syntax</code>. Every language has its own <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">syntax</code>, which is to instruct computer do a specific task. These syntax is mandatory and must be followed. For example, in order to draw a circle in p5.js, we must call <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">circle()</code>, which is a term that can be understood by p5.js.</li>
      <li>The coordinate system shows us how to navigate on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">canvas</code>, like a map. Each coordinate includes a measurement of the horizontal axis <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> and another one of the vertical axis <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">y</code>. This helps computers execute the drawing instruction exactly at where we want. In p5.js the position (0, 0) is at the top left.
  <img src="https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/Learn-p5/animation/canvas-origin.png" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>To finish a drawing, we have to divide it into small subtasks. Finishing all of them leads to the finish of our drawing.</li>
  <li>Programming works on the same concept. In order to complete a big task, we write codes that execute small tasks. Each chunk of code is called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">function</code>. Each function has its own purpose. For example, to finish drawing a robot, we might have functions to draw different parts of a robot, for example: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eye()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">nose()</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">face()</code>, … This is not just to help break down the solution to easier task, but also help us efficiently re-use the code. We will discuss more about function later.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>👨🏻‍🏫 Notes for teachers while teaching</p>

  <p>Despite knowing the syntax, teachers should demonstrate the use of documentation so students can get used to it and practice by themselves.
Getting bugs while live-coding is a good chance to teach debugging! Don’t shy away.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="p5js-editor">p5.js editor</h3>

<ul>
  <li>p5 Web Editor makes it easier to code.
    <ul>
      <li>Users can write and run the code instantly to see the result.</li>
      <li>All the coding happens on the cloud, not in your local machine. Just like Google Docs.</li>
      <li>There are options to share your sketch in different views: edit or fullscreen.</li>
      <li>Sketches are saved and organized.</li>
      <li>The p5 Web Editor also have a mobile version that students can explore later.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="function-basic-shapes-and-styling">Function, basic shapes, and styling</h3>

<ul>
  <li>p5.js has many built-in functions for example the drawing functions.
    <ul>
      <li>p5.js provides user with a well-written documentation at https://p5js.org/reference/.</li>
      <li>It’s a common practice in program to use documentation as a guide, even for senior programmers as syntax might change and vary from time to time, in different libraries.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Function is like a box that can take inputs, process the inputs, and produce outputs.
    <ul>
      <li>A function input is restrictedly designed by the one who wrote the function.</li>
      <li>A function can require one, many, or no inputs.</li>
      <li>Similarly, a function can also produce one, many, or no outputs.</li>
      <li>The inputs of a function are called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parameter</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Function can be built-in (provided by the library by default), or designed by developers - us. We stick with the built-in functions for now.</li>
  <li>By default of the p5 editor, there are two functions <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setup()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">draw()</code>. We will more about these two functions later.</li>
  <li>For now, all the code for drawing will be written within the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">draw()</code> function. By <em>within</em> we mean that every drawing code should be within the curly brackets “{}” of the function and has an indent - a tab at the beginning of the line compared to the function line.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Inside the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setup()</code> function, we write the all the set-up needed for our drawing. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createCanvas()</code> sets up a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">canvas</code> on which we can draw. Change parameters inside to change the size of the canvas. For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">createCanvas(300, 300)</code> to create a 300px * 300px canvas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Introduce <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">circle()</code> built-in function. Search <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/">Reference</a> and answer:
    <ul>
      <li>What does <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">circle()</code> do?</li>
      <li>What are the required inputs of the function?</li>
      <li>What is the output of the function?
<script type="text/p5" data-p5-version="1.7.0" data-autoplay="" data-preview-width="300" src="/lectures/snippets/s1_circle.js"></script></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Add color into the sketch.
    <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">background()</code>: to change the background color.</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fill()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">noFill()</code>: to fill color into the shapes.</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stroke()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">noStroke()</code>: to change color of the border of the shapes.</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strokeWeight()</code>: to change the thickness of the border of the shapes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>All the functions above receive parameters as color code in RGB.
    <ul>
      <li>A common RGB color code looks like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(255, 48, 67)</code>, for example. It includes measurement of color in three channels Red, Green, and Blue.</li>
      <li>So a finish syntax would look like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">background(255, 48, 67)</code></li>
      <li>Read more about RGB colors: https://p5js.org/learn/color.html</li>
      <li>Pick your <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=color+pickers&amp;oq=color+pickers&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDE0NzRqMGo0qAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">your own RGB color</a></li>
      <li>Transparency: In case you want to add opacity into your drawing, you can decide it at the forth channel - <em>alpha</em>, with value ranges from 0 (completely transparent) to 255 (completely solid). For example: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">background(255, 48, 67, 100)</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<script type="text/p5" data-p5-version="1.7.0" data-autoplay="" data-preview-width="300" src="/lectures/snippets/s1_color.js"></script>

<ul>
  <li>Order of code matters in p5.
    <ul>
      <li>The styling functions (color and stroke) need to be called <strong>before</strong> the drawing functions that they apply to.</li>

<p><strong>STRUCTURE OF A P5 SKETCH</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The <em>setup()</em> function is executed first and executed for only one time when you run a p5 sketch.</li>
  <li>The <em>draw()</em> function is executed after the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setup()</code> and executed repeatedly according to the the setting of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frame rate</code>.</li>
  <li>In the below example:
    <ul>
      <li>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">background</code> is moved to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setup()</code> so the background is only <em>painted</em> one time when we started the sketch.</li>
      <li>The circle painting is drew on top of each other again and again as the function <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">draw()</code> repeat. Hence, it’s getting more and more solid.</li>
      <li>🏄🏻‍♂️ Tweaking the code to experiment yourself.
<script type="text/p5" data-p5-version="1.7.0" data-preview-width="300" src="/lectures/snippets/s1_opacity_over_time.js"></script></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>frameRate: number of frames appear in one second - fps. By default, 60 frames per second.</li>
  <li>We can adjust the frame rate by adding, for example, <em>frameRate(10)</em> in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setup()</code> to adjust the frame rate to 10 frames per second.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>VARIABLE, ANIMATION, AND MOUSE INTERACTIVITY</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Now that we have a still drawing, let make it move. For example, make the circle move across the canvas.</li>
  <li>In order to make the circle move across the screen, we need to adjust its location over time. For example, to move to the right, we need to increase its x-coord by 1 every frame.</li>
  <li>Instead of giving a fixed location, we now use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">variable</code> to host the value of x-coord. So we can give a new value to the variable x at every frame. And by that, make the circle move.</li>
</ul>

<p>The syntax will look like this:
<script type="text/p5" data-p5-version="1.7.0" data-preview-width="300" src="/lectures/snippets/s1_moving_circle.js"></script></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Observations:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">let</code> to declare a variable.</li>
    <li>Using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">=</code> to assign value to a variable.</li>
    <li>As the draw() repeats itself every frame, we can use it to increase our x-coord.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li>Beside variables that are declared by users, we also have system variables. They are variables but reserved by the library by default.</li>
  <li>For example, <em>mouseX</em> and <em>mouseY</em> are system variables that host the location of the mouse cursor on the canvas.</li>
  <li>Using <em>mouseX</em> and <em>mouseY</em> to move the circle.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="️activity-animate-and-interact">🏄🏻‍♂️ Activity: Animate and Interact</h2>
