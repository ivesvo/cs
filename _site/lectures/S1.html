DISCUSSION

- What mediums are these projects on?
- What is the purpose of code in each project? (Eg: it is used to process user's voice)

👨🏻‍🏫  NOTES:
This can be done as a group activity with guided questions, or if time is limited, teachers can just teach while asking students these questions.

<h3 id="the-idea-of-programming">The idea of programming</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The main concept of programming based around input → code → output. <em>Think about the body of code as a machine that takes inputs as ingredients and spits out output as dishes</em>.</li>
  <li>Reflect on the example projects:</li>
  <li>Each project uses different “code”, but it still follows the above idea of code. What are the <em>inputs</em> and <em>outputs</em> of each project?
    <ul>
      <li>Clappy Bird: clap (sound) → animation on screen (visual)</li>
      <li>Music by Hand: hand movement (visual) → music playing (sound)</li>
      <li>Deep Swamp: environment (data sensor) → data to adjust the aquarium environment (physical computing)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In each project, how do we (or the subject) communicate with the machine?
    <ul>
      <li>Clappy Bird: clap → change of sound amplitude → code → change of the location of visual element on screen</li>
      <li>Music by Hand: movement of hand → change of input data → code → change of music frequency.</li>
      <li>Deep Swamp: change of environment (e.g. lighting) → change of input data → code → change of lighting data.</li>
    </ul>

Code is a set of rules (algorithms) that maps the input into the output. Or here, adjust the output according to the change of input. 
This links to our course core value: to use coding as a medium to document and react to the change of the nature around us.
Show some projects that are built using p5.js. This can be teacher’s personal projects, past students projects, other artists, or the <a href="https://showcase.p5js.org/#/">p5 Showcase</a>. Based on this, students can have a sense of what p5 can do and what to expect as an outcome of this class in term of technicality.

<h3 id="programming-with-p5js">Programming with p5.js</h3>

<p>In this course, we learn to code using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p5.js</code>. It is a library, written on the language of Javascript. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">p5.js</code> is designed for coders who want to create interactive, visual programs that run directly in a web page. It’s designed for creative coding, and it sits right at the intersection of coding and art.</p>

<p>📖 Show some projects that are built using p5.js. This can be teacher’s personal projects, past students projects, other artists, or the <a href="https://showcase.p5js.org/#/">p5 Showcase</a>. Based on this, students can have a sense of what p5 can do and what to expect as an outcome of this class in term of technicality.</p>

<h3 id="advantages-of-p5js">Advantages of p5.js</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Designed for creative coding.</li>
  <li>Can integrate with other platform.</li>
  <li>Collaborative: easy to show, duplicate, and share.</li>
  <li>Easy to access: p5 editor, documentation, and supporting resources.</li>
  <li>Open source.</li>
  <li>Community.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Students are divided into pairs. Each pair is given a serie of drawings that they need to copy.
But only one member can see the drawing and they need to use words to guide the other to draw.</li>
  <li>Drawings are simple shapes that range from easy to difficult to draw. For example:</li>

<p><b>REFLECTION</b></p>

<ul>
  <li>Drawing instructions need to follow some sort of agreement - <i>syntax</i> and <i>coordinate system</i></li>
  <li>
    <p>The coordinate system in p5.js that we will use later has (0, 0) at the top left.
<img src="https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/Learn-p5/animation/canvas-origin.png" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>Divide the task into small sub-tasks which can be complete by a <em>function</em>:
    <ul>
      <li>Modularity</li>
      <li>Reusability</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="️teach">🗣️ Teach</h2>

<aside>
👨🏻‍🏫 Notes for teachers:

- Despite knowing the syntax, teachers should demonstrate the use of documentation so students can get used to it and practice by themselves.
- Getting bugs while live-coding is a good chance to teach debugging! Don’t shy away.
</aside>

<h3 id="p5js-editor">p5.js editor</h3>

<ul>
  <li>p5 Web Editor makes it easier to code.
    <ul>
      <li>Users can write and run the code instantly to see the result.</li>
      <li>All the coding happens on the cloud, not in your local machine. Just like Google Docs.</li>
      <li>There are options to share your sketch in different views: edit or fullscreen.</li>
      <li>Sketches are saved and organized.</li>
      <li>The p5 Web Editor also have a mobile version that students can explore later.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="function-basic-shapes-and-styling">Function, basic shapes, and styling</h3>

<ul>
  <li>p5.js has many built-in functions for example the drawing functions.
    <ul>
      <li>p5.js provides user with a well-written documentation at https://p5js.org/reference/.</li>
      <li>It’s a common practice in program to use documentation as a guide, even for senior programmers as syntax might change and vary from time to time, in different libraries.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Function is like a box that can take inputs, process the inputs, and produce outputs.
    <ul>
      <li>A function input is restrictedly designed by the one who wrote the function.</li>
      <li>A function can require one, many, or no inputs.</li>
      <li>Similarly, a function can also produce one, many, or no outputs.</li>
      <li>The inputs of a function are called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">parameter</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Function can be built-in (provided by the library by default, or designed by developers - us). We stick with the built-in function for now.</li>
  <li>By default of the p5 editor, there are two functions <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setup()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">draw()</code>. For now, we only write our drawing code within the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">draw()</code> function.</li>
  <li>Introduce <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">circle()</code> function. Search <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/">Reference</a> and answer:
    <ul>
      <li>What does <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">circle()</code> do?</li>
      <li>What are the required inputs of the function?</li>
      <li>What is the output of the function?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<script type="text/p5" data-autoplay="" data-preview-width="300" src="/lectures/snippets/s1_circle.js"></script>

<ul>
  <li>Add color into the sketch.
    <ul>
      <li><em>fill()</em> and <em>noFill()</em></li>
      <li><em>stroke()</em> and <em>noStroke()</em></li>
      <li><em>strokeWeight()</em></li>
      <li>Stick with RGB for now. More about color will come in the Image lectures later.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Order of execution in p5.
    <ul>
      <li>The styling functions (color and stroke) need to be called <strong>before</strong> the drawing functions that they apply to.</li>
      <li>All the drawing code is organized within the <em>draw()</em> function for now. <em>More information about why will comes next.</em></li>

<p><strong>VARIABLE, ANIMATION, AND MOUSE INTERACTIVITY</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Structure of a p5 sketch:
    <ul>
      <li>The <em>setup()</em> function is executed first.</li>
      <li>The <em>draw()</em> function repeats itself according to the the setting of frame rate.
        <ul>
          <li>Change the opacity of the background to demonstrate that the draw() function draws over the previous drawing.</li>
          <li>frameRate: number of frames appear in one second - fps.</li>
          <li>frameCount: number of frames that have been drawn by far.</li>
          <li>By default, the frame rate is 60 frames per second.</li>
          <li>We can adjust the frame rate by using <em>frameRate()</em>, or extract the value of frame count using <em>frameCount()</em></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In order to make the circle move across the screen, we need to adjust its location x-coord, y-coord over time. For example, to move to the right, we need to increase its x-coord by 1 every frame.</li>
  <li>Introduce variable and use variable to host the value of x-coord.
    <ul>
      <li>Using let to declare a variable.</li>
      <li>Using “=” to assign value to a variable.</li>
    </ul>

  <li>As the draw() repeats itself every frame, we can use it to increase our x-coord.</li>
