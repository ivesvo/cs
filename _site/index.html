                        <p>We are CodeSurfing, a backyard-science study club in Ho Chi Minh City,
                            Vietnam. Our club brings programming closer to the Vietnamese community through teaching,
                            sharing, and supporting interdisciplinary study in art and technology. At CodeSurfing, we
                            learn, have fun, create, and co-create. Activities in CodeSurfing include:

                        <h2>Our 1st Course ⎯ Sensory Narratives</h2>
>>>>>>> 031e16a (saturday)
                        <p>Sensory Narratives is the first course developed by CodeSurfing. The course guides students
                            to use creative coding as a way to connect us human and our nature.</p>

                        <p>
                            Since the early day of life, human is at one with nature. Our body senses, reacts, and
                            reflects upon the nature that we are living in, constantly. In the recent digital
                            landscape, those intimate rapports seems to fade under the shadow of new virtual
                            technologies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Can we mediate the broken string between human, nature, and technology?
                            This course re-connects us with the vivid world around using programming. Toward the end of
                            this course, we learn to use p5.js to build a cohesive system that
                            observes, documents, and visualizes the <i>changes</i> that are happening in our nature.
                            We also learn to integrate programming into our existing creative practice using
                            libraries, APIs, and devices to further manifest our artworks in new formats.</p>
                        </p>

                        <h4>What we provide</h4>
                        <p>⤷ COURSE OUTLINE ⎯ A designed and tested curriculum to teach creative coding using p5.js.</p>
                        <p>⤷ SAMPLE LECTURE ⎯ Each session comes with a sample lecture as a script to guide teachers and
                            students to teach and learn.
                            Activities in a sample lecture include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>OBJECTIVES: Before you start. Checklist of what need to be done / group of skills need
                                to be acquired within the session.</li>
                            <li>WARM-UP: Questions or showcase to get learners engage with today's topic. Oftentimes,
                                followed by a discussion.</li>
                            <li>TEACH: Sharing and demonstration from teachers, includes recommend teaching flow or
                                ready-to-use code demo.</li>
                            <li>ACTIVITY: Quick practice, discussion, or group activity to help students get a quick
                                grasp of what they have learnt. Oftentimes, followed by a refection to summary
                                and contemplate. This is important, highly recommend not to skip it.</li>
                            <li>COOL-DOWN: Time for answering class questions or quick recommend of further reading or
                                resources.</li>

                        <p><i>We currently provide sample lectures for Unit 1. Others units are to be updated!</i>
                        </p>

                        <p>⤷ UNIT PROJECT
                        <ul>
                            <li> Each unit comes with a Unit Project, where students learn to apply their
                                study into application. Detail guidance for each unit project can be found at the last
                                session of each unit. </li>
                            <li> We also provided a sample project to help student envision the scope. Similar to
                                these sample projects, we expect student to write a description about their work (idea,
                                method, and technicality). Even a small work must have a description. This is a step
                                stone toward to
                                better practice in documentation and to
                                create with mindfulness.</li>
                        </ul>
                        </p>

                        <h4>For teachers</h4>
                        <p>
                            Each sample lecture is designed for a approximately 90-minute session. The sample
                            lectures are suggestive. Please use them as references and not hesitate to
                            inteprete them into your own style!
                        </p>

                        <h4>For students</h4>
                        <p>
                            Use this to have a better view of the course: what to expect and what to prepare.
                            If you are learning by yourself, do not afraid to go off the topics and surf into new
                            areas that pique your interest. But always, keep this outline as a North Star for your
                            surfing journey. Also, you are not alone. Connect to CodeSurfing through our events/social
                            media to reach out and share your work with others.

                                        Ahoy! In this very first unit, we will get to know p5.js, its built-in
                                        functions, and how to use them to create meaningful interaction between user and
                                        computer. We also learnt to use the p5 web editor and practice consulting
                                        the p5 online documentation.
                                    </p>

                                        By the end of this unit, we make <b>an interactive letter</b>
                                        and send it to our loved ones. In this very intimate format of a letter, we use
                                        technology as
                                        a bridge to deliver our thoughts and emotion. The letter can be made using
                                        material
                                        that we learnt in class (shape, color, typography) and elaborated with animation
                                        and interaction via mouse and keyboard. More information about the unit project

                                        Upon the connection with computer we have established in Unit 1, we continue to
                                        build a more sensory interaction: seeing.
                                        Can computer see things as the way human do? In this unit, we learn to apply
                                        coding into
                                        capture and analysing images. We also learn to program a project on a more
                                        professional level,
                                        away from pure online editor.

                                        For this unit project, students will use camera and other recording devices to
                                        capture the <i>essences</i> of where they are living. We incorporate programming
                                        to highlight those essences either through manipulating the images' structure or
                                        semantics.

                                    <p>“All the strangers I met on Bờ Kênh Nhiêu Lộc” is a reflection of myself living
                                        in the overwhelming Saigon, where I ride 12km every day to work. It is a still
                                        film with a huge cast trying to get through the screen yet no one is the main
                                        character. To make this, I performed object detection on a dashcam driving
                                        through Saigon.
                                        The model extracted drivers and placed them on the mural.

                                        Human practices require the ability of analyzing signals that we can
                                        neither see nor hear. Fishermen relies on currents, winds, and inherited
                                        knowledge to navigate. Farmers relies on rain level and temperature to adjust
                                        their harvest.
                                        This unit will guide students to design a cohesive system from devices
                                        and bodies of code to sense and make sense of surrounding data that beyond
