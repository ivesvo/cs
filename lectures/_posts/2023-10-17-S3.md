# üåû¬†Warm-up

Today objectives: Coding makes it easy to automate tasks that are repetitive while making adjustment along the way.

‚Üí Using code to make (dynamic) pattern.

- Introduce ‚Äú**Ethnicity**‚Äù - a digital library of Vietnamese ethnic pattern.

    ![Untitled](lectures/S3/imgs/thumb-2.png)
    
    - The project is born to be an archive of cultural values and craftsmanship of ethnic people in Vietnam.
    - Role of digitalization in documenting and conserving changes in culture and heritage.
    - The adding value of coding:
        - Fast to create.
        - Light to keep.
        - Dynamic in use.
        - Easy to apply and adapt.
    
    Teacher picks a simple pattern and together with students to break down the unit of the pattern and the logic.
    
    Ask student to draw the unit pattern using p5. 
    
    *This session can be converted into a field trip to museum or gallery. And extended into asking students to document the patterns they are interested in during the trip.* 
    

# üó£Ô∏è¬†Teach

- We need to repeat the unit drawings to create a pattern ‚Üí Copy and repeat the whole body of code?

**FUNCTION**

- Beside built-in functions, we can also design our own function.
    - Review on purpose of function: modularity and reusability.
    - Need to define the input (parameters) and outputs.
- Design the function to draw the unit drawing.
- Ask students if we move the unit drawing around, which position value will change?
    - Start with many variables
    - Show that these are relative to each other.
    - Work out to only a few important variables.
- Now instead of repeating the whole body of code. We only call the function as the same way that we use the built-in functions.

[THIS PART IS BORING, FIND A BETTER WAY TO TEACH]

**TRANSLATE, PUSH AND POP**

- Using translate to move the coordination system to a new position.
- Using push/pop to save and restore state of the canvas.

**SCALE AND ROTATE**

- scale() and rotate() simply resize your drawing.
- angleMode() is called in the setup() to decide the angle mode that you are using for the sketch:
    - DEGREE
    - RADIAN
- scale and rotate can be used to create animation or effect for interaction.

**DRAWING WITH VERTEX**

- Using beginShape(), vertex(), endShape() to draw polygon in p5.
- Using curve() and bezier() to create curves.
- Speed up process by importing svg sketch from AI.
    - What is svg? The structure of svg.
    - Convert svg file into p5.js code with [https://svg2p5.com/](https://svg2p5.com/)
    - Put the converted code into a function and use translate, scale, and rotate to adjust.

TO BE RESEARCHED: Export SVG in p5.

# üèÑüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è¬†Activity

- Ask students to package the unit drawing into function.
- Use translate, push, pop, scale, rotate to scatter the canvas.

**ITERATION**

- while loop repeats the body of codes until the condition is satisfied.
- while loop has the same format with *if* condition syntax.
- When writing a loop, we must notice
    - the condition to end the loop (otherwise it will loop forever)
    - the initialization of the counter.
    - the increment of the counter.
    
    ```jsx
    // while (*condition*) {*expression*}
    
    let counter=0;
    let sum=0;
    while (counter<10) {
    		sum+=counter;
    		counter+=1;
    }
    ```
    
- Because of its repetition, we can use while loop to create multiple visual objects.
    
    ```jsx
    TBD
    ```
    
- for Loop is similar with while loop. Instead, the counter initialization, condition to end loop, and the increment of the counter are all written within the syntax.
    
    ```jsx
    // for (*initialization; condition; increment*) {*expression*} 
    let sum = 0;
    for (let counter=0; counter<10; counter++){
    	sum+=counter;
    }
    ```
    
- Using nested *for* loop to iterate through *rows* and *columns*.
- Loop is heavy in computation. So beware.

# üèÑüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è¬†Activity

- Complete the pattern using loop.
