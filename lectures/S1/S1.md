<b>DISCUSSION</b>

1. What mediums are these projects on?
2. What is the purpose of code in each project? (Eg: it is used to process user's voice)

👨🏻‍🏫 Note for teachers:
This can be done as a group activity with guided questions, or if time is limited, teachers can just teach while asking students these questions.

THE PURPOSE OF CODE: 
- Automation, connectivity, and scalability.

CODE FOR CREATIVITY:
- Can integrate with other disciplines.
- Expand creative possibilities.

THE IDEA OF PROGRAMMING: input → code → output. Think about code like a machine that takes input ingredients and spits out output product. 
Reflect on the example projects: 
- Each project uses different “code”, but it still follows the above idea of code. Determine the input and output of each project.
    - Clappy Bird: clap (sound) → animation on screen (visual)
    - Music by Hand: hand movement (visual) → music playing (sound)
    - Deep Swamp: environment (data sensor) → data to adjust the aquarium environment (physical computing)
- In each project, how do we (or the subject) communicate with the machine?
    - Clappy Bird: clap → change of sound amplitude → code → change of the location of visual element on screen
    - Music by Hand: movement of hand → change of input data → code → change of music frequency.
    - Deep Swamp: change of environment (e.g. lighting) → change of input data → code → change of lighting data.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Code is a set of rules (algorithms) that maps the input into the output. Or here, adjust the output according to the change of input. 
This links to our course core value: to use coding as a medium to document and react to the change of the nature around us.
Show some projects that are built using p5.js. This can be teacher's personal projects, past students projects, other artists, or the [p5 Showcase](https://showcase.p5js.org/#/). Based on this, students can have a sense of what p5 can do and what to expect as an outcome of this class in term of technicality.

ADVANTAGE OF P5.JS:
- Designed for creative coding.
- Can integrate with other platform.
- Collaborative: easy to show, duplicate, and share.
- Easy to access: p5 editor, documentation, and supporting resources.
- Open source.
- Community.

# 🏄🏻‍♂️ Activity: Human Fax Machine .
- Students are divided into pairs. Each pair is given a serie of drawings that they need to copy.
But only one member can see the drawing and they need to use words to guide the other to draw.
- Drawings are simple shapes that range from easy to difficult to draw. For example:

<b>REFLECTION</b>

- Drawing instructions need to follow some sort of agreement - <i>syntax</i> and <i>coordinate system</i>
- The coordinate system in p5.js that we will use later has (0, 0) at the top left.
<img src="https://static-assets.codecademy.com/Courses/Learn-p5/animation/canvas-origin.png" width=100%>

- Divide the task into small sub-tasks which can be complete by a *function*:
    - Modularity
    - Reusability

# 🗣️ Teach

<aside>
👨🏻‍🏫 Notes for teachers:

- Despite knowing the syntax, teachers should demonstrate the use of documentation so students can get used to it and practice by themselves.
- Getting bugs while live-coding is a good chance to teach debugging! Don’t shy away.
</aside>

**P5.JS EDITOR**

- p5 Web Editor makes it easier to code.
    - Open and introduce the p5.js briefly and move fast to experiment the drawing syntax.
    - The p5 Web Editor also have a mobile version that students can explore later.

**FUNCTION, DRAWING BASIC SHAPE, AND STYLING.**

- p5.js has many built-in functions for example the drawing functions.
    - p5.js provides user with a well-written documentation at https://p5js.org/reference/.
    - It's a common practice in program to use documentation as a guide, even for senior programmers as syntax might change and vary from time to time, in different libraries. 
- Function is like a box that can take inputs, process the inputs, and produce outputs.
    - A function input is restrictedly designed by the one who wrote the function.
    - A function can require one, many, or no inputs.
    - Similarly, a function can also produce one, many, or no outputs.
- Function can be built-in (provided by the library by default, or designed by developers - us). We stick with the built-in function for now.
- Introduce <i>circle()</i> function. Search Reference and answer: 
    - What does <i>circle()</i> do?
    - What are the required inputs of the function?
    - What is the output of the function?
- Add color into the sketch.
    - *fill()* and *noFill()*
    - *stroke()* and *noStroke()*
    - *strokeWeight()*
    - Stick with RGB for now. More about color will come in the Image lectures later.
- Order of execution in p5.
    - The styling functions (color and stroke) need to be called **before** the drawing functions that they apply to.
    - All the drawing code is organized within the *draw()* function for now. *More information about why will comes next.*

# 🏄🏻‍♂️ Activity: Draw a window

- Looking through a window, what do you see? Draw it using only basic shapes.
<<<<<<< HEAD
    - It can be the window of your room, your parents, this classroom, or any window in your imagination.
    - Started Code:
    <iframe class="p5-embed" height="500px" src="https://editor.p5js.org/nhaninsummer/full/Gb4I0Poyf"></iframe>
    - Remind students to use p5.js [Reference](https://p5js.org/reference/) as a guide.
    - Challenge students to explore other drawing functions (rectangle, triangle, ellipse, arc).

**VARIABLE, ANIMATION, AND MOUSE INTERACTIVITY** 

- Structure of a p5 sketch:
    - The *setup()* function is executed first.
    - The *draw()* function repeats itself according to the the setting of frame rate.     
        - Change the opacity of the background to demonstrate that the draw() function draws over the previous drawing.
        - frameRate: number of frames appear in one second - fps.
        - frameCount: number of frames that have been drawn by far.
        - By default, the frame rate is 60 frames per second.
        - We can adjust the frame rate by using *frameRate()*, or extract the value of frame count using *frameCount()*  
- In order to make the circle move across the screen, we need to adjust its location x-coord, y-coord over time. For example, to move to the right, we need to increase its x-coord by 1 every frame.
- Introduce variable and use variable to host the value of x-coord.
    - Using let to declare a variable.
    - Using “=” to assign value to a variable.
- As the draw() repeats itself every frame, we can use it to increase our x-coord.
    ```javascript
        x = x + 1
        // Or in short, 
        x += 1
    ```
- Aside from dynamic variables, we also have system variable. They are variables but reserved by the language.
- mouseX and mouseY indicate the location of a mouse on the canvas.
- Using mouseX and mouseY to move the circle.

# 🏄🏻‍♂️ Activity: Animate and Interact

- Pick one element of your drawing and make them animate.
- Adjust the opacity of the object and background to create blurry effect.
- Adjust the speed of the animation
- Pick one element of your drawing and make them follow the mouse.

# 🌅 Cool-down / Q&A

- Variable naming conventions: camelCase.
- Zoom out and chat about other tools/languages.
- In 1 minute, ask students to write down 3 things that they learn today.

# 🤹 Assignment

- Continue on your drawing.
- Make at least one animation.
- Make at least one mouse interaction.

👨🏻‍🏫 Notes for teachers:

- Optional but not recommend to ask students to share with class because some might be shy and discouraged as it is their very first exercise).
