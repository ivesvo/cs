                            We are CodeSurfing, a backyard-science study club in Ho Chi Minh City,
                            Vietnam. Our club brings programming closer to the Vietnamese community through teaching,
                            sharing, and supporting interdisciplinary study in art and technology. To us, technology is
                            initimate, beautiful, and affordable. At CodeSurfing, we learn and have
                            fun through creating. Activities in CodeSurfing include:
                        </p>

                            <li>🏄🏻‍♂️ gathering sessions to help participants with no prior experience in programming
                                approach creative coding,</li>

                            <li>🏄🏽‍♀️ in-depth class to provide participants essential tools to realize their idea in

                        <p>Through this, we hope to create a creative community where everyone has the opportunity to

                        <h2>Our 1st Course ⎯ Sensory Narratives 🀥</h2>
                        <p>
                            Sensory Narratives is the first course developed by CodeSurfing. The course
                            introduces
                            creative coding
                            to first-time programmer while viewing programming as a intimate platform to connect
                            us back
                            to our nature.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since the early day of life, human is at one with nature. Our body senses, reacts,
                            and
                            reflects upon the nature that we are living in, constantly. In the recent digital
                            landscape, those intimate rapports seems to fade under the shadow of new virtual
                            technologies.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Can we mediate the broken string between human, nature, and technology?
                            This course re-connects us with the vivid world around using programming. Toward the
                            end of
                            this course, we learn to use p5.js to build a cohesive system that
                            observes, documents, and visualizes the <i>changes</i> that are happening in our
                            nature.
                            We also learn to integrate programming into our existing creative practice using
                            libraries, APIs, and devices to further manifest our artworks in new formats.</p>

                                        Upon the connection with computer we have established in Unit 1, we
                                        continue to
                                        build a more sensory interaction: seeing.
                                        Can computer see things as the way human do? In this unit, we learn to
                                        apply
                                        coding into
                                        capture and analysing images. We also learn to program a project on a
                                        more

                                        Human practices require the ability of analyzing signals that we can
                                        neither see nor hear. Fishermen relies on currents, winds, and inherited
                                        knowledge to navigate. Farmers relies on rain level and temperature to
                                        adjust
                                        their harvest.
                                        This unit will guide students to design a cohesive system from devices
                                        and bodies of code to sense and make sense of surrounding data that
                                        beyond
                                        our seeing and hearing.
